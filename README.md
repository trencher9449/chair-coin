# CoinChair Website

Welcome to the CoinChair website! This project is dedicated to the first meme coin based on the absurd joke that anything can become a chair. Each day, the community declares a new "official chair of the day" based on the most ridiculous objects.

## Project Overview

The CoinChair website features an interactive section titled "Is It a Chair?" where users can upload any photo, and our humorous algorithm will always respond with "Yes, it's a chair!" along with an absurd justification generated by AI. This concept embraces total absurdity and surreal humor while encouraging fun and participatory interaction.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML document that structures the webpage and includes links to CSS and JavaScript files.
- `styles.css`: Contains the styles for the website, defining layout, colors, fonts, and overall appearance.
- `script.js`: Handles user interactions, including image uploads and generating humorous responses.
- `images/logo.svg`: The logo for the CoinChair website.
